Final Bootcamp Project done by [Rosi Maryam](https://github.com/rmaryam42) and  [Sergii](s.lebed@yahoo.com).

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using various machine learning algorithms. We address class imbalance, normalize the data, and evaluate multiple classifiers including a decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machine, AdaBoost, k-nearest neighbors, and Naive Bayes. For this purpose, such tools as Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public, Streamlit and MySQL were used.


## Dataset

The dataset contains various features about transactions and whether they are fraudulent. The target variable is 'Fraud'.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Handle missing values if any.
    - Encode categorical variables.
    - Normalize the features.
    - Handle class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

2. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train multiple classifiers:
        - Decision Tree
        - Random Forest
        - Gradient Boosting
        - Support Vector Machine
        - AdaBoost
        - K-Nearest Neighbors
        - Naive Bayes
    - Evaluate the models using accuracy, recall, and classification reports.
  
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions. By handling class imbalance and normalizing the data, we ensure that the models are well-trained and provide reliable predictions. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy and recall help in understanding the performance of each model.

## Recommendations
Based on the insights from the models, businesses can:
    - Implement fraud detection systems to flag suspicious transactions in real-time.
    - Improve fraud prevention strategies by understanding patterns in fraudulent transactions.
    - Enhance the features and services that contribute to secure transactions.
